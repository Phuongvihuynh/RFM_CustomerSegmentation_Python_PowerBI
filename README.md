# RFM_CustomerSegmentation_Python_PowerBI
## Introduction:
The project aimed to research and analyze historical retail data from a store to identify customer groups. after
that, I analyze customer demographics and behavior, purchasing trends, and sales revenue of each customer group
and store. To achieve this, I applied the RFM model, demographic, and behavior analysis to filter out anonymous
data points. The results were used to gain insights into consumer preferences and support decision-making.

## RFM Analysis
- RFM analysis is a technique used to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. It involves evaluating three key dimensions:

* Recency(R): Measures the time elapsed since the customer's last purchase. Customers who made recent purchases are more likely to be engaged and responsive.
* Frequency(F): Measures the number of purchases made by a customer over a specific period. Frequent customers are often more valuable to the business.
* Monetary Value(M): Measures the total value of purchases made by a customer. Customers with higher monetary value contribute more to the business revenue.
  
- By analyzing these dimensions, RFM analysis assigns scores to each customer and categorizes them into different segments, such as:

* High-Value Customers: Customers with high RFM scores, indicating recent, frequent, and high-value purchases. These customers are crucial for business growth and should be retained.
* Low-Value Customers: Customers with low RFM scores, indicating infrequent, low-value purchases. Strategies should be developed to convert them into high-value customers or determine if they are worth retaining.
* Churned Customers: Customers who haven't made purchases for a long time. Identifying these customers can help in implementing targeted re-engagement strategies.

- RFM analysis provides a powerful framework for understanding customer behavior and tailoring marketing strategies accordingly.
